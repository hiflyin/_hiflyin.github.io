title:  Deep Learning Framework for Text Meaning Match
---

A configurable deep learning framework, using Keras, for training deep algorithms over a grid of parameters, applied to 
document matching, specifically, Quora question pairs as example.

why? because one can build grid search algorithms on top to find the best parameters..

The project is on github [here](https://github.com/hiflyin/Deep-Learning-Framework-for-Text-Meaning-Match)
