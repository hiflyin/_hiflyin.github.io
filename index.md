I'm an experienced and enthusiast Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer; excited about posting articles useful for solving science 
and industry problems.

My journey in Machine Learning started after a few years of software engineering at one of the big technology companies, where 
I got inspired to pursue a career in this field and decided to adventurously embark in a Machine Learning PhD.

During my early PhD days I explored many problems in AI such as triple extraction from text, probabilistic ontologies and reasoning,
inductive logic programming and deep learning. One idea I would always chase was that of progressing AI to understand ourselves, extend 
our life and improve our health. One day I wondered: if we could make sense of all the variables or features
affecting our intelligence and health and build preventive and predictive models about that .. wouldn't it be great?
But there are so many of them .. an astonishing number of features describing our brain and body and our environment. 
So there we have the theoretical question of how to navigate through this high-dimensional noisy data and extract what is important 
and predictive for target phenotypes such as intelligent behavior or health features and diseases.
Yes, we may be able to train neural networks to capture highly non-linear functions from data but how would we select and extract 
the right data first? Or embed such mechanism in a a model? And which assumptions should we pick?
The questions are still yet to be explored and I'm constantly keeping an eye focused on the latest papers and research,  
writing articles and implementing new concepts - to describe and/or challenge the ideas.

Over the years I have worked on projects and used AI to contribute to a variety of businesses in the industry and Kaggle and 
some of the articles and projects posted here are also inspired by these real world problems.
